    <h1>Gordon Ramsay</h1>

    <h3>The Early Days</h3>

    <p>Scottish by birth, UK chef Gordon Ramsay was brought up in <span class="important">Stratford-upon-Avon, England</span>, and initially aspired to be a professional footballer. However, when an injury prematurely put an end to any hopes of a promising career on the pitch, Ramsay went back to college to complete a course in hotel management. His dedication and natural talent led him to train with some of the world’s leading chefs, including <span class="important">Albert Roux</span> and <span class="important">Marco Pierre White</span> in London, and <span class="important">Guy Savoy</span> and <span class="important">Joël Robuchon</span> in France.</p>

    <h3>Michelin-Starred Restaurants</h3>

    <p>In 1993, Ramsay became head chef of <span class="important">Aubergine</span> in London, and within three years Aubergine was awarded two Michelin stars.</p>

    <p>At the age of 31, Ramsay branched out on his own to set up his first wholly-owned and namesake restaurant, <span class="important">Restaurant Gordon Ramsay</span>. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay opened in 1998, and quickly received the most prestigious accolade in the culinary world – <span class="important">three Michelin stars</span>. Today, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is London’s longest-running restaurant to hold this award, and Ramsay is one of only four chefs in the UK to maintain three stars.</p>

    <p>Now internationally renowned and holding a number of Michelin stars, Ramsay has opened a string of successful restaurants across the globe, from Italy to the United States. These include <span class="important">two ventures in Doha, Qatar</span>, which opened in 2012; <span class="important">a restaurant in Bordeaux</span>; <span class="important">three restaurants in Las Vegas (Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris, Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill at Caesars Palace and Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood)</span>; <span class="important">Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill</span> in Atlantic City; <span class="important">Bread Street Kitchen</span> and <span class="important">London House</span> in Hong Kong; and <span class="important">Bread Street Kitchen</span> in Singapore.</p>

    <p>In the UK, the Gordon Ramsay Group has opened new locations across London, including <span class="important">Union Street Café</span>, <span class="important">London House</span>, <span class="important">Heddon Street Kitchen</span> and two further <span class="important">maze Grills</span>, one of which is located on the former Aubergine site on Park Walk, Chelsea.</p>

    <h3>Gordon Ramsay on TV</h3>

    <p>Ramsay has also become a star of the small screen both in the US and internationally as a TV chef, with four top-rated FOX shows that air in more than 200 territories worldwide. These critically-acclaimed shows include <span class="important">Hell's Kitchen</span>, <span class="important">MasterChef</span>, <span class="important">MasterChef Junior</span>, and <span class="important">Hotel Hell</span>, as well as UK shows: <span class="important">Gordon Behind Bars</span>, <span class="important">Ultimate Cookery Course</span>, <span class="important">Gordon's Great Escapes</span> and <span class="important">Gordon Ramsay: Shark Baits</span>.</p>

    <h3>Other Ventures</h3>

    <p>While best known as a celebrity chef now, Ramsay has seen success in a variety of other ventures outside of food and television too. Most notably as a published author, Ramsay has released a number of books, many of which have become best-sellers around the world; including his autobiography, <span class="important">Roasting in Hell's Kitchen</span>. Aside from this, Ramsay has a <span class="important">global partnership with WWRD (Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton)</span>, which offers quality home and lifestyle products.</p>

    <p>In 2006, in recognition of all that Ramsay has contributed to the industry, he received an <span class="important">OBE (Order of the British Empire)</span>, awarded by Queen Elizabeth II. Since then, Ramsay and his wife, Tana, set up the <span class="important">Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation</span> in 2014, to make a meaningful difference to the charities that are important to them.
