    <h1> Ada Lovelace </h1>

    <img src="800px-Ada_lovelace_portrait.jpg">

    <p>My name is Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace. I am the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron, you may have heard of him. But I am most well known for my work on Charles Babbage's early mechnical computer, known as the Analytical Engine. I have written quite an amount about the computer and for the computer. You could call that an algorithm. You could say I am the first female computer programmer.</p>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>It is quite tragic that I died at 38 of cancer. I've become somewhat of an icon among the female coding community. A symbol of lost potential.</p>
