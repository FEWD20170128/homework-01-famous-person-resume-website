  <p><span class="initial-cap">C</span>houpette is the pet cat of Karl Lagerfeld, head of design and creative director at Chanel. Originally belonging to the French male model Baptiste Giabiconi, Choupette was given as a gift to Lagerfeld around Christmas 2011 following a stay with the designer while Giabiconi was abroad.

  <p>Her first media appearance was made via the social networking service Twitter on January 16, 2012, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChoupettesDiary">@ChoupettesDiary</a>, when V magazine's Stephen Gan tweeted a photo of her from Lagerfeld's apartment. With the launch of Choupette's own Twitter account (authored by Ashley Tschudin) in June 2012 and multiple 'interviews' in high-end fashion magazines, her celebrity has grown, prompting Lagerfeld to remark "People are stunned by her ... Soon people will talk more about Choupette than about me!" As of March 2015, she has more than 46,000 fans on the Twitter account invented in her honor.
