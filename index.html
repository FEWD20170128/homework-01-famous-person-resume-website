      Godzilla is a professional mutated dinosaur that feeds off nuclear energy. Years ago (millions of years, mind you), Godzilla began life as a Godzillasaurus. At a whopping 12 meters, capable of threatening only minor creatures at that juncture in his life, the then-Godzillasaurus ran into some good and bad luck, hibernating before an awfully large asteroid destroyed most of life on Earth, but waking up later (yes, millions of yearsâ€”it was a millions-year nap) to nuclear testing. Godzilla tries not to think of himself as a metaphor for post-WWII nuclear proliferation, but he just can't help himself.

      In a following state of animalistic anger and hunger (one might say Godzilla was hangry, and still is), Godzilla earned his reputation as King of the Monsters by both saving Tokyo and other poorly circumstanced cities from King Ghidorah, Battra, Biollante, Mechagodzilla, Destroyah, and monsters of the like, while also managing to destroy those aforementioned poorly circumstanced cities all by himself.

      Note: Godzilla is NOT responsible for any damage done on the premises of any work establishment. Please treat Godzilla with respect and he will (probably) not breathe nuclear fire on you, quickly stripping you of your humanhood, striking abject terror in the hearts of all.
