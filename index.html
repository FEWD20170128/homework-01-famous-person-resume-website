    <h1>Queen Elizabeth I</h1>

    <h2>I live an exciting life as the queen of England</h2>

    <p>
      I ruled my country from 1558-1603, giving me 45 years of experience. I never married and as such ruled England on my own with the help of my many advisers. "To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them that bear it."
