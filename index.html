  <h2>Past Achievements</h2>

  <p>
    Hello, my name is Alan Mathison Turing. I was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist who lived in the first half of the 20th century. I was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. I'm widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

  <h3>Career Highlights</h3>

          <span class="Ali">Cracking Codes and Killing Nazis,</span> <small>Government Code and Cypher School WWII</small>
        </h4>

        <p>
          As one of the UK's leading crypotgraphers, I devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. I played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated that my work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.

        </h4>

        <p>
          In "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", I addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". My idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.
