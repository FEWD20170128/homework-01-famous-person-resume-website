  <h2>Future Goals</h2>

  <p>
    This part is complicated. I'm currently dead, but if I was to return to life, I'd do at least these three things (in no particular order):
      <ol>
        <li>I'd work with leading researchers to further my research on AI.</li>
        <li>I'd study the current state of encryption technology and develop enhanced security for all electronic communications.</li>
        <li>I'd love to try a burrito -- we didn't really have the best Mexican food in the UK in the 1940s and 50s.</li>
      </ol>
